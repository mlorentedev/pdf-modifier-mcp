## Git Workflow

We use **GitHub Flow**:

1.  **Fork** the repository.
2.  **Clone** your fork locally.
3.  **Create a feature branch** from `master`:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feat/my-awesome-feature
    ```
4.  **Make changes** and ensure tests pass (`make check`).
5.  **Commit** your changes using Conventional Commits (see below).
6.  **Push** to your fork and submit a **Pull Request** to `master`.

## Commit Convention

We use [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) to automate versioning and changelogs.
Pre-commit hooks will validate your commit messages automatically.

| Prefix | Meaning | Version Bump |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `feat:` | New feature | Minor (0.x.0) |
| `fix:` | Bug fix | Patch (0.0.x) |
| `docs:` | Documentation only | None |
| `style:` | Formatting, missing semi-colons, etc. | None |
| `refactor:` | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature | None |
| `perf:` | Code change that improves performance | Patch (0.0.x) |
| `test:` | Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests | None |
| `chore:` | Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools | None |
| `BREAKING CHANGE:` | (Footer) Introduces a breaking API change | Major (x.0.0) |

**Examples:**

```

## Pull Request Process

1.  Ensure `make check` passes locally.
2.  Update `README.md` or `docs/` if you changed functionality.
3.  The CI pipeline will run automatically on your PR.
4.  Once merged to `master`, a new release will be published automatically if applicable.
